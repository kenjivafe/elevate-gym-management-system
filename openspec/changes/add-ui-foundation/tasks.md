## 1. Planning & Design

- [ ] 1.1 Audit existing Next.js pages and Tailwind config to confirm no conflicting UI assets.
- [ ] 1.2 Define layout wireframes and token palette for navigation, dashboard, and card designer states.

## 2. Implementation

- [ ] 2.1 Scaffold shared layout shell (header, sidebar, content frame) with mocked navigation links.
- [ ] 2.2 Add dashboard widgets consuming mock data providers for KPIs, recent activity, and quick actions.
- [ ] 2.3 Build membership card designer view with live preview, form inputs, and disabled save actions.
- [ ] 2.4 Implement loading, empty, and disabled state components reusable across UI modules.

## 3. Validation

- [ ] 3.1 Review UI in desktop and mobile breakpoints for layout fidelity.
- [ ] 3.2 Document interaction flows and mock data contracts to unblock future backend wiring.
- [ ] 3.3 Run lint/test suites (or Storybook checks if configured) to ensure UI shell compiles cleanly.
